<p><em>Find it at OU</em> is a bookmarklet that tries to give students and researchers, of the Open University, access to papers behind the paywall. This bookmarklet creates a shortcut between the page of a paper (DOI) and its downloadable version (pdf). Once installed in your browser, you are just one click away from its download. Happy reading :)</p>
<h1 id="about">About</h1>
When you want to download a paper, let's say from Springer, ScienceDirect, and so many others, there is a fee to pay and you may need the support of the OU Library to download it. With this piece of code you get their fastest support.<br/>
Once in a while (usually when cookies expires) you will be required to login again into the OU system so you are granted to download as many papers as you want.
<h1 id="requirements">Requirements</h1>
<ul>
<li>Having an Open University account (OUCU)</li>
<li>The OU Library must have a subscription for that journal</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="how-to-install">How to install</h1>
<p>Drag this link <a style="font-weight: bold;" href="javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='https://rawgit.com/angelosalatino/find-it-at-ou/master/convert-link.js';})();">Find it at OU</a> and drop it into your Bookmarks bar</p>
<img src="finditatou.PNG" alt="" />
<h1 id="try-and-see-how-it-works">Try and see how it works</h1>
<p>Follow this paper <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-53637-8_13" alt="DOI of Detection of Embryonic Research Topics by Analysing Semantic Topic Networks">https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-53637-8_13</a> and hit the button "Find it at OU" from your Bookmarks bar. You can realise that the button "Buy eBook/PDF" will become "Download Book"</p>
<h1 id="legal-stuff">Legal stuff</h1>
<p>This bookmarklet is completely <strong>legal</strong> as it relies on the OU Library proxy and it basically grants access only to those journals the library has a subscription</p>
<h1 id="acknowledgements">Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>I would like to thank Theodoros (Theo) Georgiou for providing useful insights</p>
