# Find it at OU

*Find it at OU* is a bookmarklet that tries to give students and researchers, of the Open University, access to papers behind the paywall. This bookmarklet creates a shortcut between the page of a paper (DOI) and its downloadable version (pdf). Once installed in your browser, you are just one click away from its download. Happy reading :)

# About
When you want to download a paper, let's say from Springer, ScienceDirect, and so many others, there is a fee to pay and you may need the support of the OU Library to download it. With this piece of code you get their fastest support.
Once in a while (usually when cookies expires) you will be required to login again into the OU system so you are granted to download as many papers as you want.

# How to install

# Legal stuff
You may not believe, but *yes* it is legal.
