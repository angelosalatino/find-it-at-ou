# Find it at OU

*Find it at OU* is a bookmarklet that tries to give students and researchers, at the Open University, access to papers behind the paywall. Once installed in your browser, the bookmarklet will create a shortcut between the page of a paper (DOI) and its downloadable version (pdf). Once in a while (when cookies expires) you will be required to login again into the OU system so you are granted to download as many papers as you want. Happy reading :) 

# Requirements
